                    I am Aman Pandya. I have been using computers since my childhood. I used to play computer games for hours and would stick to computer for hours.
                    When I reached 11th grade, I got to realize that I am good with computers and code. Not that, I had thought what I wanted to be then.
                    We were asked to make projects in 12th grade and one night, I remain awake till 5 just trying to make the project as I was imagining in my head.
                    When it came to choosing what do I want to do, I could only think of that night when I did not care about anything and was having fun.
                    And hence I became a software developer with time.
